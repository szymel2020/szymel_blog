<p>My first game was created after a year of learning. The game is to draw letters that are to form a word. For each word, the player receives points which, after clicking the plus, falls into the box. Completing all the points causes the display of the word "win!".<br>
I used HTML, CSS, and javascript to write the game. In javascript I used functions, arrays, switch. I also used responsiveness in CSS. </p>
